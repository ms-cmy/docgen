# xd - Automated Documentation Generator

## 1. Project Overview

`xd` is a command-line tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive README.md files for your projects. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), `xd` analyzes your codebase and creates insightful documentation, saving you time and effort.

This tool is invoked via the `desafio-globo` command and configured using a YAML file, allowing for flexible customization of the documentation generation process.

## 2. File Structure

```

│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── cli.py          # Defines the command-line interface (desafio-globo)
│   └── agent_doc_gen/

```

*   **`doc_gen/`**:  The main package directory containing all source code.
    *   **`cli/`**:  Modules related to the command-line interface.
        *   **`cli.py`**:  Defines the `desafio_globo` CLI entry point using the `click` library. It handles input file arguments and calls the documentation generation logic.
    *   **`agent_doc_gen/`**: Modules containing the core documentation generation agents and logic.
        *   **`long_agents.py`**: Implements the `DocGen` class and `docgen_runner` function, which orchestrate the documentation generation process using LLMs.
*   **`setup.py`**:  Configures the package for installation, including dependencies and the `desafio-globo` console script entry point.

## 3. Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:** (Assuming this project is in a git repository)
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd xd
    ```

2.  **Install the package:**
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    or for editable installs during development:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This will install the `xd` package and make the `desafio-globo` command available in your terminal.

### Usage

To generate a README.md for your project, run the following command:

```bash
desafio-globo -f <path_to_your_config.yaml>
```

or

```bash
desafio-globo --file <path_to_your_config.yaml>
```

*   Replace `<path_to_your_config.yaml>` with the path to your YAML configuration file. This file should define the prompts, LLM configurations, and other settings for the documentation generation process.  **(Note:** The structure and content of this YAML file are not detailed in this README and would need to be defined separately based on the project's design.)

If the specified YAML file is found, the tool will:

1.  Print the file path to the console.
2.  Execute the documentation generation process based on the configuration in the YAML file.
3.  Generate a `README.md` file and file summaries in the current working directory.

If the file is not found, it will print "sem arquivo" to the console.

## 4. Key Features

*   **Automated README Generation:**  Streamlines the documentation process by automatically creating README.md files using LLMs.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface (`desafio-globo`) for generating documentation.
*   **YAML Configuration:**  Allows for flexible customization of the documentation generation process through YAML configuration files. This likely includes settings for:
    *   **LLM Selection:**  Utilizes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (and potentially other LLMs) for text generation.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Employs `PromptTemplate` for defining and customizing prompts used by the LLMs.
    *   **File Handling:**  Recursively explores project directories to identify code files for summarization.
*   **Code Summarization:**  Analyzes and summarizes individual code files to provide context for the generated README.
*   **Token Usage Tracking:**  Monitors and logs the total number of tokens consumed by the LLMs during the documentation generation process.

This tool aims to simplify and accelerate the creation of project documentation, ensuring your projects are well-documented and easily understandable.
