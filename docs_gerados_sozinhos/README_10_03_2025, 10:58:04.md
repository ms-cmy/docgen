# Vector Database API for Semantic Search

## Project Overview

This project provides a Flask API for generating text embeddings, storing them in a PostgreSQL database with vector support, and performing semantic similarity searches. It leverages a pre-trained sentence embedding model to convert text into vector representations, enabling efficient retrieval of semantically similar documents. The API is designed to facilitate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and similar applications requiring semantic search capabilities over code documentation or other textual data.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1.  **Start the PostgreSQL Vector Database:**
    Navigate to the `infra/postgresql` directory and start the database using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    cd infra/postgresql
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    This command will start a PostgreSQL database instance configured for vector operations using the `pgvector` extension.

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `api_endpoint_models` directory and install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    cd ../api_endpoint_models # Assuming you are in infra/postgresql directory
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask API:**
    From the `api_endpoint_models` directory, start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The API will now be running, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

4.  **Access API Endpoints:**
    You can now interact with the API endpoints. Here are a few examples:

    -   **Health Check:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/health`
    -   **Generate Embeddings:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/rag` (with JSON payload containing `sentences`)
    -   **Save Embeddings to Database:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/to_bd` (with JSON payload containing `sentences`, `function_names`, `code_snippets`)
    -   **Retrieve Similar Embeddings from Database:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/retrive_from_banco` (with JSON payload containing `query_phrase`)

    Refer to the `api_endpoint_models/app.py` file for a complete list of endpoints and their expected request formats.

## Key Features

*   **Health Check Endpoint (`/health`):**  Verifies if the API is running.
*   **Text Embedding Generation (`/rag`):**  Generates sentence embeddings for input text using a pre-trained multilingual model.
*   **Embedding Storage (JSONL & Database):**
    *   Saves embeddings to a JSONL file (`/emb_save`).
    *   Persists embeddings in a PostgreSQL database with vector support (`/to_bd`), preventing duplicate entries based on function names.
*   **Semantic Similarity Search (JSONL & Database):**
    *   Retrieves similar embeddings from a JSONL file (`/retrive`).
    *   Performs efficient similarity searches against embeddings stored in the PostgreSQL database (`/retrive_from_banco`) using cosine similarity and HNSW indexing for optimized performance.
*   **PostgreSQL Vector Database:** Utilizes PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for robust and scalable vector storage and similarity search capabilities.
*   **Dockerized PostgreSQL Setup:** Provides a Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment of a PostgreSQL vector database.
*   **Logging:** Includes logging for debugging and monitoring API operations.

This API provides a foundation for building applications that require semantic understanding and retrieval of textual information, particularly in code documentation and related domains.
