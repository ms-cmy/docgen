File: api_endpoint_models/__init__.py
Summary: Empty file; initializes the `api_endpoint_models` directory as a Python package.

File: api_endpoint_models/app.py
Summary: Defines a Flask API for text embedding and similarity search. Endpoints include: `/health` (health check), `/rag` (generate embeddings), `/emb_save` (save embeddings to JSONL), `/retrive` (retrieve from JSONL), `/to_bd` (save embeddings to database), and `/retrive_from_banco` (retrieve from database).  It uses a pre-trained model for embeddings and PostgreSQL for database storage, supporting RAG applications.

File: api_endpoint_models/db_connect.py
Summary: Manages connection and interaction with a PostgreSQL database named "vectordb". Functions include: `get_connection` (establishes database connection), `check_if_exists` (checks for document existence), `insert_document` (inserts document with embedding), and `get_similarity` (performs cosine similarity search on embeddings).

File: api_endpoint_models/model_loader.py
Summary: Loads and utilizes a pre-trained multilingual sentence transformer model from the `transformers` library. Key functions are: `mean_pooling` (calculates sentence embeddings), `run_model` (generates embeddings for input sentences), and `retrivel_model` (computes cosine similarity between embeddings).

File: api_endpoint_models/requirements.txt
Summary:  Declares `Flask` for web API framework and `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL database interaction as dependencies, indicating a Python web application interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

File: infra/.gitkeep
Summary: Empty file; used by Git to track the `infra` directory, even though it's empty.
