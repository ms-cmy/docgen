# Text Embedding and Retrieval API

## Project Overview

This project provides a Flask API for generating and retrieving text embeddings. It leverages a pre-trained sentence embedding model to convert text into vector representations, enabling semantic similarity searches and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. The API supports storing embeddings in both JSONL files and a PostgreSQL database, offering flexibility for different use cases.

-   **`api_endpoint_models/`**: Contains the core Python code for the API.
    -   **`__init__.py`**:  (Empty) Initializes the `api_endpoint_models` package.
    -   **`app.py`**: Defines the Flask API application, including endpoints for health checks, embedding generation, saving embeddings (to JSONL and database), and retrieval of similar embeddings.
    -   **`db_connect.py`**:  Handles database interactions with a PostgreSQL database named "vectordb". Provides functions for connecting, checking for document existence, inserting documents, and performing similarity searches.
    -   **`model_loader.py`**:  Loads and manages the sentence embedding model (using Hugging Face Transformers). Includes functions for generating embeddings and calculating cosine similarity.
    -   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the API, such as Flask and psycopg2.
-   **`infra/`**:  Intended for infrastructure-related files (currently contains an empty `.gitkeep` file as a placeholder).

## Getting Started

To run this API, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Python 3.x
    -   pip package installer
    -   PostgreSQL database server (for database storage functionality)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r api_endpoint_models/requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Database Setup (if using database features):**
    -   Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database named `vectordb` running.
    -   Configure database connection credentials within `api_endpoint_models/db_connect.py`.  The current configuration is set for local access.

6.  **Run the API:**
    ```bash
    cd api_endpoint_models
    flask run
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

7.  **API Endpoints:**

    -   **`/health`**:  Check API health status. (GET)
    -   **`/rag`**: Generate embeddings for input sentences. (POST) - Expects JSON payload with sentences.
    -   **`/emb_save`**: Generate and save embeddings to a JSONL file. (POST) - Expects JSON payload with sentences, function names, and code snippets.
    -   **`/to_bd`**: Generate and save embeddings to the PostgreSQL database. (POST) - Expects JSON payload with sentences, function names, and code snippets.
    -   **`/retrive`**: Retrieve similar embeddings from the JSONL file based on a query phrase. (POST) - Expects JSON payload with a query phrase.
    -   **`/retrive_from_banco`**: Retrieve similar embeddings from the PostgreSQL database based on a query phrase. (POST) - Expects JSON payload with a query phrase.

    Refer to the `api_endpoint_models/app.py` file for detailed input and output formats for each endpoint.

## Key Features

-   **Text Embedding Generation:** Utilizes a pre-trained multilingual sentence transformer model (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) to generate high-quality sentence embeddings.
-   **Multiple Storage Options:** Supports saving embeddings to both JSONL files for simple storage and a PostgreSQL database for more robust and scalable solutions.
-   **Similarity Retrieval:** Enables efficient retrieval of semantically similar text snippets based on cosine similarity calculations against stored embeddings.
-   **Database Integration:**  Provides seamless integration with PostgreSQL for persistent storage and retrieval of embeddings, including duplicate entry prevention.
-   **Health Check Endpoint:** Includes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring API availability and status.
-   **Performance Logging:** Implements logging to track API performance and facilitate debugging.
-   **Input Validation and Error Handling:** Incorporates input validation and error handling to ensure API robustness.
-   **RAG Ready:** Designed to be a core component in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, facilitating the retrieval of relevant context for language models.
