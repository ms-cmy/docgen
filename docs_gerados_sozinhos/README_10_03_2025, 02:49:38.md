Summary: Empty initialization file.

File: api_endpoint_models/app.py
Summary: Defines a Flask API for text embeddings and similarity search. Key functionalities include: embedding generation using a pre-trained model, saving embeddings to JSONL and a PostgreSQL database, and retrieving similar embeddings from both sources. Endpoints are provided for health checks, embedding generation, saving, and retrieval from local JSONL and the database.

File: api_endpoint_models/db_connect.py
Summary: Provides functions for interacting with a PostgreSQL database ("vectordb").  It includes functions to connect to the database, check for document existence, insert new documents (containing function name, embedding, text, and code), and perform similarity searches to retrieve documents based on embedding similarity.

File: api_endpoint_models/model_loader.py
Summary: Implements a sentence embedding model using Hugging Face Transformers ("paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2").  It defines functions for mean pooling of token embeddings, generating sentence embeddings from text inputs, and calculating cosine similarity between embeddings.  It leverages CUDA if available for model execution.

File: api_endpoint_models/requirements.txt
Summary: Specifies Python dependencies, primarily Flask for building the web API and psycopg2 for PostgreSQL database interaction.  This indicates the application is a Flask-based web service that interacts with a PostgreSQL database.
