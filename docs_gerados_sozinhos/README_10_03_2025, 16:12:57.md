# xd - Automated Documentation Generator

## 1. Project Overview

`xd` is a command-line tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive README documentation for your projects. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), `xd` analyzes your codebase, summarizes file functionalities, and compiles these summaries into a well-structured and informative `README.md` file. This tool streamlines the documentation process, saving developers time and ensuring projects are easily understandable.

## 2. File Structure

```

│   ├── cli/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── cli.py          # Command-line interface implementation
│   ├── agent_doc_gen/
│   │   ├── __init__.py

```

- **`doc_gen/`**:  The main package directory containing the source code.
    - **`doc_gen/cli/`**:  Contains files related to the command-line interface.
        - **`cli.py`**: Defines the CLI using the `click` library, allowing users to interact with the documentation generation tool via the `desafio-globo` command.
    - **`doc_gen/agent_doc_gen/`**: Houses the core logic for generating documentation.
        - **`long_agents.py`**: Implements the `DocGen` class, which orchestrates the process of code summarization and README generation using LLMs.
- **`setup.py`**:  Used for packaging and distributing the `xd` project. Defines project metadata, dependencies, and entry points.

## 3. Getting Started

### Installation

To install `xd`, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

Alternatively, for development purposes, you can install it in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install the `desafio-globo` command-line tool.

### Usage

To generate a README for your project, you need to provide a YAML configuration file to the `desafio-globo` command. This configuration file specifies templates for summarization, LLM settings, and file paths to be processed.

```bash
desafio-globo --file <path_to_your_config.yaml>
```

or using the short option:

```bash
desafio-globo -f <path_to_your_config.yaml>
```

Replace `<path_to_your_config.yaml>` with the actual path to your YAML configuration file.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Configuration File:** You need to create a YAML configuration file that defines the behavior of the documentation generator. Refer to the code and potentially example configurations (if available in the project) to understand the required structure and parameters within this file.
- **API Key:**  `xd` utilizes Google's generative AI models via the `langchain_google_genai` library. Ensure you have the necessary API key configured for accessing these models.

## 4. Key Features

- **Automated README Generation:**  Significantly reduces the manual effort required to create project documentation by automatically generating README files.
- **LLM-Powered Summarization:** Leverages Large Language Models to understand and summarize code, resulting in more insightful and context-aware documentation.
- **YAML Configuration:**  Offers flexible configuration through YAML files, allowing customization of prompts, LLM models, and file processing behavior.
- **Recursive File Processing:**  Can process entire project directories, recursively identifying and summarizing code files within them.
- **Code Summarization:**  Breaks down code files into summaries, providing a high-level overview of each file's purpose and functionality.
- **Token Usage Tracking:**  Monitors and logs token usage during LLM interactions, aiding in cost management and performance analysis.
- **Customizable Prompts:**  Allows users to define and customize prompts used for code summarization and README generation, enabling tailored documentation outputs.

This tool is designed to help developers quickly generate project documentation, making it easier to share and understand their work.
