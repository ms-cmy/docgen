# DocGen: Automated Documentation Generator

## Project Overview

DocGen is a command-line tool designed to automate the creation of comprehensive README documentation for your codebase. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), DocGen intelligently summarizes individual code files and synthesizes these summaries into a cohesive and informative README. This tool streamlines the documentation process, saving developers time and ensuring projects are well-documented.

## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
doc_gen/
├── agent_doc_gen/
│   ├── long_agents.py     # Core logic for documentation generation using LLMs
│   └── __init__.py
├── cli/
│   ├── cli.py           # Command-line interface using Click
│   └── __init__.py
├── __init__.py
setup.py                 # Package setup and installation
```

- **`doc_gen/agent_doc_gen/long_agents.py`**:  Contains the primary documentation generation logic. This module defines the `DocGen` class and `docgen_runner` function, which handle file processing, LLM interactions for summarization and README creation, and output generation.
- **`doc_gen/cli/cli.py`**: Implements the command-line interface (CLI) for DocGen. It uses the `click` library to define the `doc-gen` command and handle user input, such as the configuration file path.
- **`setup.py`**:  Standard Python setup file used for packaging and distributing DocGen. It defines the package name (`xd`), version, dependencies (like `click`), and the entry point for the `doc-gen` command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Access to Google Generative AI models (API key and necessary setup as per Google AI documentation - this is implied by the use of `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` in the summary, though specific setup steps are not detailed in the provided summaries).
- A YAML configuration file specifying LLM parameters, prompts, and target file paths for documentation generation (template details are not provided in the summaries but are mentioned as required).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or ensure you have the project files locally.
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory** (where `setup.py` is located) in your terminal.
3.  **Install DocGen:**
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    This command uses `setuptools` to install the package and make the `doc-gen` command available in your environment.

### Usage

1.  **Create a YAML configuration file:**  You'll need to create a YAML file to configure DocGen. This file should specify:
    -   LLM model parameters (e.g., model name, temperature).
    -   Prompts for code summarization and README generation.
    -   Paths to the directories or files you want to document.
    *(Refer to the `long_agents.py` code and any provided templates for the exact structure of this YAML file - details are not in the summaries).*

2.  **Run DocGen from the command line:**
    ```bash
    doc-gen -f <path_to_your_config.yaml>
    ```
    Replace `<path_to_your_config.yaml>` with the actual path to your configuration file.

3.  **Output:** DocGen will generate a README file named `README_{timestamp}.md` in the current directory, along with a `file_summary` file containing the summaries of individual code files. The console will display "STARTING..." and log the total token count used by the LLMs during the process.

## Key Features

- **Automated README Generation:**  Significantly reduces the manual effort required to create project documentation by automatically generating README files.
- **LLM-Powered Code Summarization:** Employs Google Generative AI models to understand and summarize code, resulting in intelligent and context-aware documentation.
- **Customizable Configuration:**  Utilizes YAML configuration files, allowing users to tailor the documentation generation process by adjusting LLM parameters, prompts, and specifying target files.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a simple and efficient command-line interface (`doc-gen`) for easy integration into development workflows.
- **File Summary Output:** Generates and saves individual file summaries, which can be useful for debugging, review, or further manual documentation enhancements.
- **Token Usage Tracking:**  Monitors and logs the total number of tokens consumed by the LLMs, providing insights into the cost and efficiency of the documentation generation process.

DocGen aims to be a valuable tool for developers seeking to automate and enhance their project documentation, ensuring codebases are easily understandable and accessible.
