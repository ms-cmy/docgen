# DocGen: Automated Documentation Generator

## Project Overview

DocGen is a Python-based tool designed to automate the generation of project documentation, specifically `README.md` files. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the `langchain-google-genai` library, DocGen intelligently analyzes your codebase and creates comprehensive documentation.  It provides a command-line interface for easy integration into your development workflow.  By using customizable prompts and configurations defined in YAML files, DocGen offers a flexible and efficient way to keep your project documentation up-to-date.

*   **`doc_gen/agent_doc_gen/long_agents.py`**: Contains the main `DocGen` class and functions responsible for loading configurations, interacting with LLMs, summarizing code files, and generating the final README.
*   **`doc_gen/cli/cli.py`**: Defines the command-line interface using the `click` library, allowing users to run DocGen from the terminal.
*   **`setup.py`**:  Standard Python setup file used for packaging and installing DocGen. It defines dependencies and the command-line entry point.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   Ensure you have a Google Cloud project set up with access to Generative AI models and have the necessary API keys configured for `langchain-google-genai`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install DocGen:**

    You can install DocGen using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    Alternatively, for development purposes, you can install it in editable mode:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Usage

DocGen is a command-line tool named `doc-gen`. To generate documentation, you need to provide a YAML configuration file using the `--file` or `-f` option.

1.  **Create a YAML configuration file:**

    You will need to create a YAML file that defines the prompts, LLM configurations, and file paths for DocGen to process. Refer to the `doc_gen/agent_doc_gen/long_agents.py` file for the expected structure of this YAML file and how templates are loaded.

2.  **Run DocGen from the command line:**

    ```bash
    doc-gen --file path/to/your/config.yaml
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    doc-gen -f path/to/your/config.yaml
    ```

    Replace `path/to/your/config.yaml` with the actual path to your YAML configuration file.

    DocGen will process the files specified in your configuration, generate summaries using LLMs, and finally create a `README_{timestamp}.md` file in the current directory. It will also save file summaries to `file_summary`.

## Key Features

*   **Automated README Generation:**  Streamlines the documentation process by automatically generating `README.md` files for your projects.
*   **LLM-Powered Documentation:** Leverages Large Language Models for intelligent and context-aware documentation generation, providing more insightful and helpful READMEs.
*   **Customizable Prompts and LLM Configuration:**  Allows users to tailor the documentation generation process through YAML configuration files, enabling customization of prompts, LLM models, and parameters.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides an easy-to-use command-line tool (`doc-gen`) for seamless integration into development workflows and automation scripts.
*   **Recursive File Processing:**  Capable of processing entire directories recursively, automatically identifying and summarizing code files within a project.
*   **Token Usage Tracking:**  Monitors and logs the total tokens consumed by the LLMs during the documentation generation process, aiding in cost management and analysis.
